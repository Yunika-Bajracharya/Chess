During the main development process, due to poor consideration, we overlooked memory leaks. 
Later on, as the leaks started piling on, we started facing difficultes to progress furthur. 
So, we used a program called valgrind to detech memory issue and found out a lot of memory leak in our program.
So we worked on solving the memory leaks.
